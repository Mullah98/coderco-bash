# Scripting With Bash module

Summary: Notes and practical work as I work through CoderCo's Linux Fundamental's module  
Contents:
- `Arena/` — The Game: Bash Battle Arena. Progress through levels 1-15 of the Bash Battle Arena game, to help improve my Bash scripting skills through a series of increasingly complex challenges.
  
- `scripting` — Scripts to practice bash concepts and best practices. Lessons I learnt throughout the module include `Variables`, `Parameters`, `If & Else statements`, `Functions`, `Error handling & Exit code`, `Piping & Redirection`, and `Environment & Path`.
